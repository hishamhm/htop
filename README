[htop](http://hisham.hm/htop/)
====

by Hisham Muhammad <hisham@gobolinux.org> (2004 - 2016)

Introduction
------------

This is `htop`, an interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`. It is developed primarily on Linux,
but we also have code for running under FreeBSD and Mac OS X
(help and testing are wanted for these platforms!)

This software has evolved considerably over the years,
and is reasonably complete, but there is always room for improvement.

Vim keybindings
----------------

These are the keybindings added in this fork of htop:

```
    g        to the top (gg in vim)

  <C-b>      up 1 page

  <C-u>      up 1/2 page

    k

h       l    one character

    j

  <C-d>      down 1/2 page

  <C-f>      down 1 page

    G        to the end

--------------------------------------------------

    o        Expand/collapse (like in NERDTree)
```

In order to accomodate these keybindings, the following changes
were made to the original keybindings:

* Ctrl+F and Ctrt+B can no longer be used to navigate horizontally
* 'h' can no longer be used to access the help, leaving Ctrl+F1 & '?'
* 'k' can no longer be used to kill processes, being replaced with 'x'
* 'l' can no longer be used to list open files, being replaced with 'L'


Comparison between `htop` and classic `top`
-------------------------------------------

* In `htop` you can scroll the list vertically and horizontally
  to see all processes and full command lines.
* In `top` you are subject to a delay for each unassigned
  key you press (especially annoying when multi-key escape
  sequences are triggered by accident).
* `htop` starts faster (`top` seems to collect data for a while
  before displaying anything).
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number to
  kill a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you don't need to type the process number or
  the priority value to renice a process, in `top` you do.
* In `htop` you can kill multiple processes at once.
* `top` is older, hence, more tested.

Compilation instructions
------------------------

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
See the [INSTALL](/INSTALL) file for detailed instructions.

When compiling from a [release tarball](https://hisham.hm/htop/releases/), run:

    ./configure && make

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.

If not all keys work check your curses configuration.
