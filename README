## Introduction

`htop` is a cross-platform interactive process viewer.
It requires `ncurses`.

For more information and details on how to contribute to `htop`
visit [htop.dev](https://htop.dev).

## Build instructions

This program is distributed as a standard autotools-based package.
For detailed instructions see the `INSTALL` file, which
is created after `./autogen.sh` is run.

When compiling from a [release tarball](https://github.com/htop-dev/htop/releases/), run:

~~~ shell
./configure && make
~~~

For compiling sources downloaded from the Git repository, run:

~~~ shell
./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
~~~

By default `make install` will install into `/usr/local`, for changing
the path use `./configure --prefix=/some/path`.

See the manual page (`man htop`) or the on-line help ('F1' or 'h'
inside `htop`) for a list of supported key commands.
